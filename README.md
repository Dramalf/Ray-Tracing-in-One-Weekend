# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Today, on the last weekend before the new semester starts, I completed **Ray Tracing in One Weekend**. This comes as Iâ€™ve enrolled in a course for the upcoming semester: **Advanced Image Synthesis**. This demo brought back memories of my work with Computer Graphics and using C++, it is a good review project.

Away from LLMs, just like before 2023, "slowly" learning some CS knowledge gave me a sense of nostalgia, almost like playing music on a cassette player with tapes.
